## Deploy Wallet - Connect MetaMask to Magnet Blockchain

To experience the DApps and services of the Magnet Blockchain, you first need to connect your MetaMask wallet to the Magnet network. MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that supports managing your digital assets and interacting with decentralized applications.

**Step 1: Download and Install MetaMask Wallet**

If you haven't installed MetaMask wallet yet, please visit the official MetaMask website [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) (please make sure to use the official website) to download and install the MetaMask browser extension.

*   Depending on your browser type (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge), select the corresponding MetaMask version for download.
*   Follow the instructions on the official MetaMask website to complete the installation. After installation, the MetaMask fox icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

**Step 2: Open MetaMask Wallet and Connect Network**

After installation, click the MetaMask fox icon in your browser toolbar to open the MetaMask wallet.

*   If you are using MetaMask for the first time, you need to follow the prompts to create a new wallet or import an existing wallet.
*   If you already have a MetaMask wallet, please enter your password to unlock the wallet.
*   By default, MetaMask will connect to the Ethereum Mainnet. We need to manually add the Magnet Blockchain network.

**Step 3: Add Magnet Blockchain Custom RPC**

After filling in, click the **“Save”** button.

After saving successfully, you will return to the network list.
Find the **“Magnet Chain”** you just added in the list and click it to switch to the Magnet Blockchain network.
