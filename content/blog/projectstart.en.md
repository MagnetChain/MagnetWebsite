# Magnet Chain Takes Off!

We are thrilled to announce the official launch of Magnet Chain! This is a significant milestone, marking a major step towards our vision of building a faster, lower-fee, and more accessible blockchain infrastructure.

## Introducing Magnet Chain

Magnet Chain is a Layer-1 blockchain that is both EVM-compatible and utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It's designed for high performance, capable of processing up to 7,000 transactions per second (TPS). This means Magnet Chain can handle a large volume of transactions without users having to deal with high gas fees.

The total supply of Magnet's native token, $MAG, is set at 210 million. It's a 1:1 swap from the $MAG token on the BSC chain.

## Magnet Testnet is Live

To give everyone a chance to experience the power of Magnet Chain, we've launched our testnet. We encourage you to participate in the testing phase and share your valuable feedback.

## Our Vision

With Magnet Chain, we aim to create a more user-friendly and cost-effective blockchain infrastructure, empowering the next generation of decentralized applications (dApps) to thrive. We believe Magnet Chain will play a key role in the widespread adoption and use of blockchain technology.
